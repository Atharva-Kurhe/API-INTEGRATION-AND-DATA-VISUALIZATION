# API-INTEGRATION-AND-DATA-VISUALIZATION

*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*: ATHARVA KURHE

*INTERN ID*: CT08PEM

*DOMAIN*: PYTHON PROGRAMMING

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTHOSH

*Overview of the Project*: This project retrieves weather forecast data from the OpenWeather API and visualizes the temperature trends for a specific city using a line graph. It serves as a quick and efficient way to analyze weather patterns over a short period.

*Editors*:
  Developed using any Python-supporting editor such as:
  -Visual Studio Code
  -PyCharm
  -Jupyter Notebook

*Tools and Libraries Used*:
  -requests: For fetching data from the OpenWeather API.
  -matplotlib: For creating the temperature visualization graph.

*Approach Used*:

  1]Data Retrieval:
  -Utilized the OpenWeather API to fetch weather forecast data for a given city.
  -Handled API response using the requests library to ensure successful data fetching and error handling.
  
  2]Data Processing:
  -Extracted specific data points such as temperature and corresponding timestamps from the API response.
  -Limited the data to the first 10 forecasted entries for simplicity and clarity in visualization.
  
  3]Data Visualization:
  -Created a line graph using matplotlib to plot temperature against timestamps.
  -Enhanced readability with labels, gridlines, and rotated x-axis ticks.
  
  *Applicable Areas*:
  -Weather forecasting and analysis.
  -Educational purposes for learning API integration and data visualization in Python.
  -Quick visualization of temperature trends for travel planning or local weather monitoring.
